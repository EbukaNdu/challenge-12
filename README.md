In this challenge I imported the establishment collection into my new created database named uk_food. During this process I was able to review the database to make sure I had the corret data, add the new restaurant that was asked of me to be added into my analysis, and make the updates and modifications that were inquired.
I found that there are 41 establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20 including The Chase Rest Home, Melrose Hotel, Seaford Pizza, and more.
There are 33 establishments in London that have a Rating Value greater than or equal to 4 like Mv City Cruises Erasmus,	Coombs Catering t/a The Lock and Key, The Nuance Group (UK) Limited, and more
The top 5 establishments with a rating value of 5 are all in plumstead and are Volunteer, Plumstead Manor Nursery, Atlantic Fish Bar, Iceland, Howe and Co Fish and Chips - Van 17.
